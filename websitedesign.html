SCSI4005 Website Design

What we did:
The overall goal was to produce an interactive website and document the process of doing so
This meant first conducting research into existing websites that have similar goals to our own
Then we had to design our website, including colours we would use and general layout
Next we had to create the website from our design. This was the main area of work for this unit, using HTML5, CSS and Javascript
Finally we had to test the website to find any issues or areas we could improve
